### Background


The [Linux Foundation's](https://www.linuxfoundation.org/) [Hyperledger](https://www.hyperledger.org/) is an influential distributed ledger platform suitable for use in many enterprise use cases. Hyperledger is an open source collaborative effort created to advance cross-industry blockchain technologies. It is a global collaboration, hosted by The Linux Foundation, including leaders in finance, banking, Internet of Things, supply chains, manufacturing and Technology.

Dr. Leemon Baird's [hashgraph algorithm](http://leemon.com/papers/2016b.pdf) is a major step forward in distributed consensus research. Hashgraph forces us to think about the limitations current blockchain technologies and how we can create next-generation distributed ledgers of the future. Ledgers built using the hashgraph algorithm are:

- [Performant](https://www.hederahashgraph.com/platform#speed)
- [Secure](https://www.hederahashgraph.com/platform#security)
- [Fair](https://www.hederahashgraph.com/platform#security)

Hashgraph is not just an incremental step forward. It's a leap into the future.

### About the **hl-mercury** project

This project's goal is to bring the benefits of the hashgraph consensus algorithm to Hyperledger.

We are a globally distributed team of software developers, engineers and technologists who are curious about the future, passionate about next-gen DLT technology and want to apply the latest advancements in distributed consensus to the projects we're working on today.

### Getting started

Currently, we have a working Proof Of Concept that uses Hyperledger Fabric's pluggable consensus capability in order to integrate with Swirlds' Hashgraph SDK. 

See the documentation on how to run HL Fabric together with Hashgraph: [orderer-plugin-poc/README.md](orderer-plugin-poc/README.md)
